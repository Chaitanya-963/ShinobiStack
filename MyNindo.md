# 💪 My Nindo (निंडो)

I never go back on my word — that's my ninja way.

Even if it’s hard, I will show up.  
Even if I fail, I will rise.  
Even if no one believes, I will build.

> "Discipline is stronger than motivation."

🧠 Focus: One scroll at a time  
🔥 Goal: Build, Learn, Repeat  
🎯 Vision: Create tools that serve real people
